# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### My Aim with this project:
I am joining 100 days of code from today, that is 29th August, 2019. I have been coding for long now but I have not participated in
it yet. Now I think its really time to make a public commitment while preparing for a dev job that I have been preparing for a while now.

### Day 1: August 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Coded React Todo Project by following along from Brad Traversy's React Front to Back Crash Course 2019, Worked on Personal Portfolio, Solved some problems from codesignal for interview prepration, read Recurrence relations from Kenneth Rosen's Discrete maths book.

**Thoughts:** React is new for me but fun to learn. I have given a lot of time in Vanilla JS. So, I guess I am not having lots of trouble with React. But components and props are somewhat unfamiliar for me at this point of time. In Interview preparation, I am facing more difficulty as compared to Dev work. I need to practice and learn more there.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
