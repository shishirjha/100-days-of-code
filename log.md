# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### My Aim with this project:
I am joining 100 days of code from today, that is 29th August, 2019. I have been coding for long now but I have not participated in
it yet. Now I think its really time to make a public commitment while preparing for a dev job that I have been preparing for a while now.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
