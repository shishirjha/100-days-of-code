# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### My Aim with this project:

I am joining 100 days of code from today, that is 29th August, 2019. I have been coding for long now but I have not participated in
it yet. Now I think its really time to make a public commitment while preparing for a dev job that I have been preparing for a while now.

### Day 1: August 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Coded React Todo Project by following along from Brad Traversy's React Front to Back Crash Course 2019, Worked on Personal Portfolio, Solved some problems from codesignal for interview prepration, read Recurrence relations from Kenneth Rosen's Discrete maths book.

**Thoughts:** React is new for me but fun to learn. I have given a lot of time in Vanilla JS. So, I guess I am not having lots of trouble with React. But components and props are somewhat unfamiliar for me at this point of time. In Interview preparation, I am facing more difficulty as compared to Dev work. I need to practice and learn more there.

### Day 2: August 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed React Crash Course by Traversy,built the Todo App in the course,Started Brad Traversy's React Front to Back 2019 course on udemy to further my skills in MERN Stack, worked on portfolio, solved more problems for interview preparation, watched video on Recurrence Relations.

**Thoughts:** I think that React is totally new way to do things on front end from what I have done until now. I am having a little discomfort in thinking in terms of components. But at the same time it is very fun.Also, while learning React, I have got more exposure to a few concepts that I was familiar with while learning VanillaJs like map, filter and i have learnt what the spread operator is which I was not taught at all while learning JavaScript. And while learning JS, I used XHR,promises,fetch API to handle asynchronous Javascript code but in this crash course I got the opportunity to learn third party axios to interact with external api. New things are on the way!!

### Day 3: August 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent very less time on react course but more time on Portfolio website setting up the node-sass took lot of my time. All other time was spent on learning some divide and conquer algorithms and solving some problems on codesignal.

**Thoughts:** To code 1 hour a day is not a big task, I need to put in more hours to get the job as developer as soon as possible.

### Day 4: September 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went a little off-track, and completed most of the MongoDB M001 course by MongoDB University.

**Thoughts:** I need to increase my speed both in terms of dev work and algorithmic skills. I am able to understand and work on dev side decently but algorithmic side is equally important.

### Day 5: September 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed MongoDB course and back to react course by brad traversy on udemy.

**Thoughts:** I found out that the new React course by Traversy covers the whole MERN app. So, chances are that I will get the opportunity to learn full MERN stack in this course. Hoping to learn MERN asap and start my own web app from scratch.

### Day 6: September 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on class based components in the first project of the course React Front to Back 2019 by Brad Traversy on Udemy. Worked for 1 hr on Portfolio website. Designed navbar in the header and introduced the typewriter effect.

**Thoughts:** We can work with React in two ways nowadays. One is old class based components and newer functional components which can also have states like class based components using new concept called hooks which I have not come across yet. So, there are so many things coming which I am excited about. But one thing which is making me sad is I am not giving enough time to problem solving which I must give.

### Day 7: September 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched two videos from MIT6006 on algorithms, solved two problems on arrays and matrices from hackerrank and codesignal. moved ahead in react course on udemy. Worked for 1 hour on portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** I am finding that solving problems is the main way you can really learn algorithms that is by practicing them. But some algorithmic concepts like dynamic programming are so not-intuitive. So, if we want to tackle such problems it is good to learn basic theory before practicing problem. Day by day I realise more and more that solving algorithmic challenges and thinking algorithmically is more challenging and difficult for me then learning from dev courses. Real challenges will appear while starting my own projects in dev side. I am excited and scared a little too of upcoming projects.

### Day 8: September 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solved two problems on array,matrices and grids. Moved ahead on a react course. Learnt about Routes in React and how to link routes. Made first pull request on any open source project(Mozilla)

**Thoughts:** Need to practice more and more algorithmic problems daily. September 6th will be the last day for arrays and then I will move on to next category. First pull request on open source project was awesome.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
